##Plant Vision

Fine-tuning a semantic segmentation neural net on plant phenotyping datasets,
collated from botany laboratories around the world.
Training on multiple datasets increases the ability of the trained network to generalize.
This is our goal in deploying networks into the field, resilience to odd conditions, and still giving sensible results.
Field conditions on farms and inside greenhouses can be extreme, and also vary widely in short time spans.
Light levels, moisture, temperature, and other pertinent characteristics of the growing conditions are all uncontrolled,
in contrast to laboratory settings.
So to generalize for field conditions, we train on multiple collated datasets with an eye towards appropriate transforms
that can improve predictive outcomes even further.
